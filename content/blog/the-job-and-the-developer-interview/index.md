About 6 weeks ago I noticed a web developer position open up at a company that I worked at previously. I applied there, but I wasn’t super optimistic about it because of my lack of professional experience. I thought that I might get to experience a developer interview to help me know what to expect in the future.

Eventually, I did get that interview, and it actually went really well. The next day, I was offered the job, and I will be starting on Monday. There were a few things that I took away from this experience, and I thought I would share them here.

## Developer Interview Tips

1. Don’t be afraid to apply somewhere even if you don’t feel qualified. This is especially true if you have a connection with that particular company.
2. If you do get an interview, ask an established developer for advice. My brother is a WordPress developer, and while I won’t even touch WordPress at this job, he did give me an idea of what kinds of questions to expect.
3. Over prepare for the interview. I spent a few hours reviewing development concepts in each language I was expected to use at this job. If you are like me then you have likely been spending a few hours coding each night anyway so it shouldn’t be hard to find the time.
4. If you don’t know something, don’t be afraid to let them know. It is way better to just be honest than try to fake it. Even if you are able to make it through the rest of the interview and get the job at that point, they will still expect you to come in knowing and understanding something that you do not.
5. No matter how much you dislike your current job, do not mentally check out during your final weeks. I have worked at an ad agency in a small department of three or four people for the last two years. I have seen some people mentally check out before leaving, and I have been left to clean up their messes. If you haven’t experienced this, it’s awful. Don’t be someone who causes it. You don’t know if web development is even going to work out. If it doesn’t, you will be glad that you left a good impression with your previous employer.

## The Future

Now that I have this job, the direction of the blog will be changing slightly. I will be coding primarily in php, mysql, javascript, and jquery, so there will likely be more posts about those languages. I still plan on completing at least the first half of Free Code Camp so there will still be more of those posts in the future, but they will be less frequent.
