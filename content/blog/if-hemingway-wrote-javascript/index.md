Up until this week, I had never actually read a programming book all the way through. Although, I'm not sure that If Hemingway Wrote Javascript by Angus Croll really counts as a typical coding book. It's only a couple hundred pages, and although it has many coding samples in javascript, it is more of a discourse on the creative possibilities of the Javascript language.

The introduction explains that the book is dedicated to showing how various authors would let their writing styles show in Javascript. The book is broken out into five assignments, and each one has the code samples of five authors. Each author is spotlighted with an introduction of their literary works and writing style, their code, and then an explanation of that code. In between each assignment is a short parody of a famous literary work.

## The Good

- The premise of the book is brilliant and original.
- It provides examples of some obscure features of javascript. I had a lot of "I didn't know you could do that" moments.
- It is interesting to see the different ways that each algorithm is solved.
- It is very light and entertaining for a programming book.

## The Bad

- The digital version has very small text, and is difficult to read on a phone or small tablet.
- All of the solutions are very interesting, but most of them fall under the category of "Don't try this at home."
- It gets a little bit repetitive towards the end.

## Conclusion

I breezed through If Hemingway Wrote Javascript pretty quickly, and I probably would have finished it in one sitting if I had a full three or four hour block of free time. If you are looking for something light, entertaining, and programming related, then I would definitely recommend it. I'm not even that interested in literature and I didn't recognize a lot of these authors, yet I found it very amusing and witty. If you specifically want a book that teaches how to code in Javascript, then this probably isn't for you.
